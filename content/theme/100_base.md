###Color schedule - Monokrom

Used just the base colors white and black in the base theme.

<table>
<tr>
<th style="background-color: black;width: 50px;height: 50px;"></th>
<th style="background-color: #fff;width: 50px;height: 50px;"></th>
</tr>
<tr style="text-align: center;">
<td>ACCENT</td>
<td>SECONDARY-1</td>
</tr>
</table>

###Font
<p style="font-family: Calibri;">For both the headings and the normal text Calibri is used and it is part of the Sans serif font family.</p>

###Design elements
Because its a base theme I wanted to add as little extra design on the site as possible such as texture, lines and shapes. The colors is kept to the basic setup,
mostly white and black.

###Design principles
I have kept the grid based layout because I wanted to keep the unity and balance that it is giving to the site. It also provides some
form of proportion to the site. I've kept the flash image from earlier course tasks and that together with the BG-logotype is
creating a contrast.
