Anax Flat - Frame work
==================================
[FIGURE src="img/dynapac/anax_128x128.png]

This site is based on the frame work [Anax-Flat](https://dbwebb.se/anax/inledning) which was created by Mikael Roos
at Blekinge Technical University. It is an open source code available at [GitHub](https://github.com/mosbth/anax).

The intention of a framework is to give the site a template that can be reused
on multiple pages.

In Dynapac its used for the local production website (this).
