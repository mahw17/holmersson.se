SQLite - Database
==================================

[FIGURE src="image/dynapac/SQLite.png?w=150" class="center w50"]

SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.

SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers. It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine, as it is used today by several widespread browsers, operating systems, and embedded systems (such as mobile phones), among others.

The database in BccInfoSys is a SQLite database.
