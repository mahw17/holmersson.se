Toolbox
===========================

The intention of this toolbox 'blog' is to describe some of the tools that
have been used when the applications have been created.

The choice of tools is mainly based of the courses given at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola
(BTH) so that it will be easy for students to help us to update/create applications
within existing school assignments.
