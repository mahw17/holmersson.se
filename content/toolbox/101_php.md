PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor
==================================
[FIGURE src="img/dynapac/PHP.svg"]
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development
but also used as a general-purpose programming language.

It can be embedded direct into the HTML-code, but should preferrable be separated
for clarification purposes.

All applications use PHP as the server-side script language for Dynapac production
web applications.
